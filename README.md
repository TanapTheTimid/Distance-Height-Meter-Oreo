This android app has two functions:
1. estimates the HEIGHT of an object by marking its base and top points.
2. estimates the GROUND distance from the user/phone to the point marked by the camera cross-hair.

The user inputs how high they hold the device (usually the same as their body height), and the app uses angle measurement taken from the phone's sensor to perform trigonometric calculations to estimate the distance between the user and the target location or the height of the object.

This app is useful for estimating a person's height or measuring a room's dimension.

As this app uses the phone's tilt sensors and an estimate of the phone's height, there will be a degree of error depending on the phone sensor's accuracy and the accuracy of the estimated phone height.

Preliminary testing shows that this app is accurate to +/- 0.1 meter when the phone height is somewhat precise.
